Independently validating experimental  results in the field of computer systems research is a challenging task. Recreating an environment that resembles the one where an experiment  was originally executed is a time-consuming endeavor. Popper is a  convention (or protocol) for conducting experiments following a DevOps  approach that allows researchers to make all associated artifacts  publicly available with the goal of maximizing automation in the  re-execution of an experiment and validation of its results.
